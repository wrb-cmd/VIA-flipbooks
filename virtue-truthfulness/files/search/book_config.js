To help encourage the development of morals and good conduct in young children, we have chosen to focus on virtues as spiritual attributes which de ne all of us, creating a common bond that transcends culture and links all of humanity. It is important to note that virtues are a divine, eternal quality of our soul and the expression and understanding of virtues are many and constantly evolving. The de nitions and actions depicted in our books are simpli ed for young children and are not meant to limit the progress of our understanding or the depth and sacredness of virtues.\n","It is our hope that these actions will lead to habits, skills and capabilities that are useful in our children’s personal development and will contribute meaningfully to building a better society. Please note that the examples in our books are generally ordered to progress from the individual to the society, and from the practical to the abstract. For each example, there is a longer sentence, likely to be read by the adult accompanying the child, followed by a shorter and simpler version that some children may be able to read themselves.\nHappy reading!\n","Truthfulness\nPerhaps, being truthful means that we have the courage to admit our mistakes and tell the truth regardless of what the consequences might be. Telling the truth can make us strong and helps develop our many other virtues to their full potential.\n","One of the best ways for children to develop their virtues is to use them in many different situations. So... Let’s see how our friends from around the world put\nTRUTHFULNESS into ACTION!\n","00?’\nV!!-\n\n","Even though it’s hard,\nI tell my mom that I broke her vase and she is pleased that I am truthful.\n","we 1?\ne-.1t,¢-£2’\n\n","I tell my friend I that broke his toy and will replace it with a new one.\n","---\n\n","When I  nd money on the ground, I return it to the owner.\n","I \n9% \n* 1\n*3\nJ   \\ ..#\n\n","When my friend and I were playing, we accidentally broke a window with our ball.

For example: the sun is bright, the grass is green, the birds are singing. Investigating the truth means learning about things yourself and not just listening to what others say about something. We can learn a lot by observing things around us. Discovering truth is fun!\nTruth-Teller’s Game\nSit at a table and put an object in the middle (a teddy bear, for example). Take turns describing the object. Notice how everyone says something a bit different, such as “It is soft,” “it is brown,” “It has a red bow,” “I like to play with it.” Listening\n","to only one description does not totally describe the entire truth of the object. Telling the truth requires explanation and questioning to get a clear picture of what is really true.\nTruth About Ourselves\nPractice being con dent talking with others and sharing truths. Take turns asking each other’s name, age, favorite foods, and what you like to do. We do not need to be shy about sharing the truth and feel good about who we are and what we think.\nImportance of Truth\nHave a puppet exaggerate about several things, such as saying they are as big as a mountain or that they can eat 10 whole bananas. Talk about how you will lose trust in someone if they are not truthful. These are some reasons why we should always tell the truth.\n","What Happens When We Are Not Truthful\nTell a story of when you or someone you know did not tell the truth, and what happened afterwards. When people do not tell the truth, people feel hurt and do not trust them any more.\nStories vs. Truth\nDeciphering truth from fantasy can be tricky, especially things we see on TV, movies or the Internet. Make up a fantastic story with your child about things that could not be true (such as  ying, living in the clouds, or meeting animals that talk). These stories are fun, but they are not reality (what is true in the real world). Some things we see (such as shows with cartoon characters) or hear about (like fairies or monsters) are not actually true but made-up stories.\n","I Tell the Truth\nI tell the truth,\nI’m glad that I do.\nI tell the truth,\nIt’s the right thing to do. I tell the truth,\nIt’s my favorite virtue.\nI always say what is true, True, true!\nThis song, from the Virtues in Us Childrenʼs Virtues Songs album, is available at:\n","The Truth\nThank you, thank you, thank you! For telling me the truth.\nYou tell me when you’re tired, So I can let you rest.\nYou tell me what you really like, So we can be the best of friends!\nYou ask before you borrow, And give things back on time. Next time that you want to,\nI know that it will be  ne!\nWhen I need a partner,\nI will call on you. Because we trust each other, There’s nothing we cannot do!\nThis song, from the Virtues in Us Childrenʼs Virtues Songs album, is available at:\n","Truthfulness\nTruthfulness is the foundation of all human virtues.
